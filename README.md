# Smartphone Compare Tool
Site built on HTML, CSS and JS working without backend allowing you to compare any two available in my smartphone list.

The script compares each characteristic separately. If one feature outperforms another, a certain score is awarded to the best-performing smartphone. After the comparison of all characteristics, the scores are counted and the results are given.

You can modify this tool. For example, add more smartphones or improve my algorithm. The site is a simplified nanoreview.net analog
